# autohotkey-mappings

These are my personal [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) scripts/mappings.

## [multimedia-keys.ahk](https://github.com/conobarry/autohotkey-mappings/blob/master/multimedia-keys.ahk)

Features media controls, mapped to the F row, an autoclicker and a helpful gui.

## [multimedia-keys-reduced.ahk](https://github.com/conobarry/autohotkey-mappings/blob/master/multimedia-keys-reduced.ahk)

Pretty much the same as the full version, but for my TMK converted keyboards. All the mappings that are included on the [TMK converter](https://github.com/conobarry/tmk_keyboard) are removed from this ahk script.
